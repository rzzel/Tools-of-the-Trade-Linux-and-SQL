Understanding Virtual Machines and Virtualization

What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualized representation of a physical computer. Virtualization, the process of creating virtual versions of physical machines using software, enables these machines to simulate physical hardware through software-defined components. In this context, "virtual" implies that these machines don't exist physically but operate as if they do. A virtual machine includes virtual CPU, storage, and other hardware components, all represented as code.

Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical computer by dividing and sharing the host computer's resources. For instance, a computer with 16GB of RAM can host three virtual machines, allocating 4GB of RAM to each virtual machine, each running its own operating system.

Benefits of virtual machines

1. Security:
   - Virtualization provides an isolated environment or sandbox on the physical host machine.
   - Virtual machines operate as guests, isolated from the host computer and other virtual machines, enhancing security.
   - Isolation allows security professionals to deal securely with infected virtual machines, and intentional malware placement for analysis can be done in a controlled environment.

   *Note: While virtualization enhances security, there are still risks, and malicious programs may potentially escape virtualization.*

2. Efficiency:
   - Virtual machines offer an efficient way to perform security tasks.
   - Multiple virtual machines can be opened simultaneously, allowing streamlined testing and exploration of various applications.

   *Analogy: Efficiency of virtual machines is comparable to a city bus efficiently transporting many people simultaneously, reducing resource consumption.*

Managing virtual machines

- Hypervisor:
  - Hypervisors are software that help manage multiple virtual machines and connect virtual and physical hardware.
  - They facilitate the allocation of shared resources of the physical host machine to one or more virtual machines.

- Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM):
  - KVM is an open-source hypervisor supported by major Linux distributions.
  - Built into the Linux kernel, KVM allows the creation of virtual machines on any Linux machine without additional software.

Other forms of virtualization

- Server Virtualization:
  - Creates multiple virtual servers from a single physical server.

- Network Virtualization:
  - Efficiently utilizes the hardware of a physical network by creating virtual networks.

Key takeaways

- Virtual machines are vital in the realm of virtualization, providing benefits such as security through isolation and efficiency in performing tasks.
- Security analysts should understand the basics of virtualization, and while there are significant advantages, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential risks of malicious software escaping virtualized environments.
