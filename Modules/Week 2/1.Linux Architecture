Linux Architecture Components:

User:

-The person interacting with the computer, initiating and managing tasks.
-Linux is a multi-user system, allowing multiple users to access resources simultaneously.7\

Applications:

-Programs designed to perform specific tasks.
-Can be pre-installed (e.g., calculators) or installed using a package manager.
A package manager helps users install, manage, and remove applications.

Shell:

-The command-line interpreter translating user commands for the kernel.
-Allows users to interact with the kernel through text-based commands.

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):

-Organizes data storage locations in the Linux OS.
-Directories (folders) organize files and other directories based on FHS.

Kernel:

-Manages processes and memory, facilitating communication with applications.
-Unique to Linux, critical for resource allocation and efficient task execution.

Hardware:

-Physical components of a computer.
-Peripheral devices (e.g., monitors, printers) are attached and controlled by the computer.
-Internal hardware (e.g., CPU, RAM, hard drive) is essential for running the computer.

Peripheral Devices:

-Hardware components attached and controlled by the computer.
-Not core components required for basic system functioning.

Internal Hardware:

-Core components necessary for running the computer.
-Includes the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and hard drive.

CPU:

-Main processor for general computing tasks.
-Executes instructions provided by programs.

RAM:

-Short-term memory used to store data temporarily during tasks.
-Data is deleted from RAM after tasks are completed or the computer is turned off.

Hard Drive:

-Long-term memory for storing programs and files.
-Retains information even after the computer is turned off.
-Multiple hard drives can be present in a computer.
-Understanding these components is crucial for security analysts to comprehend Linux architecture and its functioning.
