Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS): The FHS organizes data in Linux, defining the hierarchy of directories and storage organization in the operating system. The root directory, represented by a forward slash (/), is the highest-level directory, and subdirectories branch off from it.

Standard FHS Directories:
- /home: Each user has a personal home directory.
- /bin: Contains binary files and executables.
- /etc: Stores system configuration files.
- /tmp: Stores temporary files.
- /mnt: Stores media such as USB drives.

User-Specific Subdirectories:
- Users have subdirectories under /home for personal use, like projects, logs, or reports.

Navigating the File System Commands:
1. **pwd (Print Working Directory):** Displays the current working directory's absolute path.
2. **ls (List):** Lists files and directories in the current working directory; can take an argument for a different directory.
3. **cd (Change Directory):** Navigates between directories; accepts arguments for subdirectories or absolute file paths.

Reading File Content Commands:
1. **cat (Concatenate):** Displays the full content of a file.
2. **head:** Displays the beginning of a file (default: 10 lines); -n specifies the number of lines.
3. **tail:** Displays the end of a file (default: 10 lines); useful for log files.
4. **less:** Displays file content one page at a time, allowing navigation with keyboard controls.

Key Takeaways:
- Security analysts need to navigate Linux and the FHS file system efficiently.
- Commands like `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` are essential for navigation.
- Reading file content is crucial; commands like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `less` are useful.
- Pro tips include using `whoami` to find the current username and customizing line counts with -n in certain commands.
