**Responsible use of sudo:**

To manage authorization and authentication, use `sudo` in Linux when elevated privileges are needed. Logging in as the root user is not recommended due to security risks and potential irreversible mistakes. `sudo` temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users. Users must be given access in the "sudoers file."

Be cautious with `sudo` usage and only grant access to users who genuinely need it. Running commands with `sudo` allows users to bypass typical security controls.

**Authentication and authorization with sudo:**

**useradd:**
```bash
# Add a user
sudo useradd username
# Add to a specific group
sudo useradd -G groupName username

Adding Users:
# Add a new user
sudo useradd username

# Set password for the new user
sudo passwd username

# Add the new user to a specific group
sudo useradd -G groupName username

# Confirm the new user was added
id username


Deleting Users:

# Delete a user
sudo userdel username

# Remove user's home directory and mail spool
sudo userdel -r username

Modifying Users:
# Modify user properties (change username)
sudo usermod -l newUsername oldUsername

# Add or remove a user from a group
sudo usermod -aG groupName username
