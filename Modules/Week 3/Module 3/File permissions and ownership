Permissions in Linux:

Permissions are the type of access granted for a file or directory. Authorization is about granting access to specific resources in a system, and it's crucial to limit access to specified files or directories.

- Three Types of Permissions:
  1. Read: Allows reading of file contents or listing files in a directory.
  2. Write: Permits modifications to file contents or the creation of new files in a directory.
  3. Execute: Enables the execution of a file (for executable files) or access to a directory's contents.

- Three Types of Owners:
  1. User: The owner of the file.
  2. Group: A group consists of several users, allowing management in a multi-user environment.
  3. Other: All other users on the system.

- Representation of Permissions:
  - In Linux, file permissions are represented with a 10-character string. For example: drwxrwxrwx.
  - The first character indicates the file type (d for directory, hyphen for a regular file).
  - Characters 2-4 indicate user permissions, 5-7 for the group, and 8-10 for others.
  - r, w, x represent read, write, and execute permissions, respectively.

- Importance of Proper Permissions:
  - Critical for protecting sensitive files and maintaining overall system security.
  - Example: Payroll files should not be readable by unauthorized users.

- World-Writable Files:
  - Files where user, group, and other can all write. Considered a significant security risk.

Checking Permissions:

- ls Command Options:
  - ls -l: Displays permissions to files and directories.
  - ls -a: Displays hidden files (those starting with a period before their name).
  - ls -la: Displays permissions for files and directories, including hidden files.

Practical Demonstration:

- Using ls Command:
  - ls: Displays file contents.
  - ls -l: Displays detailed information, including permissions.
  - ls -a: Displays hidden files.
  - ls -la: Displays permissions for all files, including hidden ones.
