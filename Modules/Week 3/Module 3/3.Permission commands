Reading and Changing Permissions in Linux:

**Reading Permissions:**

- Permissions in Linux are represented by a 10-character string.
- There are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute.
- These permissions are for three types of owners: user, group, and other.
- The 10-character string represents file type, owner permissions, group permissions, and other permissions.
- The ls command with options like -l and -la can be used to explore permissions.

**Exploring Existing Permissions:**

- ls -a: Displays hidden files.
- ls -l: Displays detailed permissions, owner name, group, file size, and last modification time.
- ls -la: Combines both options, displaying detailed permissions for all files.

**Changing Permissions:**

- Principle of Least Privilege: Grant minimal access necessary for tasks.
- chmod command changes permissions on files and directories.
- chmod requires two arguments: changes to permissions and the file or directory.
- Characters used in the first argument of chmod:
  - u: User permissions
  - g: Group permissions
  - o: Other permissions
  - +: Adds permissions
  - -: Removes permissions
  - =: Assigns permissions exactly as specified

**Principle of Least Privilege in Action:**

- Example Scenario:
  - File: bonuses.txt in compensation directory.
  - Owner: hrrep1 from Human Resources.
  - Permissions: -rw-rw---- (read and write for the owner and group).
  - Issue: Violates the principle of least privilege.

- Solution:
  - Run chmod g-rw bonuses.txt to remove read and write permissions for the group.
  - Result: Aligns permissions with the principle of least privilege.

**Key Takeaways:**

- ls with -l and -la options for investigating permissions.
- chmod for changing user permissions, ensuring alignment with the principle of least privilege.

Remember to carefully manage permissions to enhance security.
