Numeric and Date/Time Data in Cybersecurity

Security analysts often work with numeric data and date/time data in addition to string data.

Numeric Data Examples:
- Number of login attempts
- Count of a specific log entry type
- Volume of data sent from a source
- Volume of data sent to a destination

Date/Time Data Examples:
- Timestamps for log records
- Login dates and times
- Dates for patches
- Duration of a connection

Comparison Operators in SQL:
- `<` (less than)
- `>` (greater than)
- `=` (equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<>` or `!=` (not equal to)

Using Operators in Filters:
- Operators are used in the WHERE clause of a query.
- Example using the > operator:

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
FROM employees
WHERE birthdate > '1970-01-01';

The > operator is exclusive, not including the specified value.
BETWEEN Operator:

Filters for numbers or dates within a range.
Example using the BETWEEN operator:

SELECT firstname, lastname, hiredate
FROM employees
WHERE hiredate BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2003-01-01';

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive, including both specified values.
Key Takeaways:

Understanding operators is crucial for filtering numeric and date/time data.
Different operators offer exclusivity or inclusivity in filtering.
The BETWEEN operator is useful for filtering within a specific range.
