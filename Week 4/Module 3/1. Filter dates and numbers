Applying SQL Queries and Filters to Different Data Types

In this tutorial, we'll delve into using SQL queries and filters for different data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

Common Data Types in Databases

1. String Data:
   - Ordered sequence of characters (e.g., user names like analyst10).

2. Numeric Data:
   - Consists of numbers (e.g., log-in attempt count).
   - Allows mathematical operations like multiplication or addition.

3. Date and Time Data:
   - Represents a date and/or time.
   - Common in filtering for specific time periods or patch dates.

Operators for Numeric and Date/Time Data

Common operators for working with numeric or date and time data types include:
   - Equals
   - Greater than
   - Less than
   - Not equal to
   - Greater than or equal to
   - Less than or equal to

Filtering Numeric and Date/Time Data

Filtering Time Data
Suppose you want to find log-in attempts made after 6 pm. You can use the greater than operator in your filter:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE time > '18:00';

Filtering Date Data with BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator filters for numbers or dates within a range. For example, finding all patches installed between March 1, 2021, and September 1, 2021:

SELECT *
FROM machines
WHERE OS_patch_date BETWEEN '2021-03-01' AND '2021-09-01';
Note: For strings, dates, and times, use quotation marks to specify conditions. For numbers, do not use quotation marks.
