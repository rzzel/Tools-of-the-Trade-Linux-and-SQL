Logical Operators in SQL

AND Operator:
- Used to filter on two conditions.
- Specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously.
- Example:

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid
FROM customers
WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';

Returns rows where both conditions are true.
OR Operator:

Connects two conditions.
Specifies that either condition can be met.
Example:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';

Returns rows where either condition or both are true.

NOT Operator:

Works on a single condition.
Negates a condition.
Example:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';

Returns rows where the condition is not true.

Combining Logical Operators:

Logical operators can be combined in filters.
Example:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';

Returns rows where both conditions are not true.

Key Takeaways:

AND requires both conditions to be true.
OR requires either one or both conditions to be true.
NOT negates a condition.
Logical operators can be combined for more specific queries.
