Working with Multiple Conditions in SQL

AND Operator:
- Use the AND operator to specify that both conditions must be met simultaneously.
- Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM machines
WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1'
  AND email_client = 'Email Client 1';


The result includes only rows that meet both conditions.
OR Operator:

Use the OR operator to specify that either condition can be met.
Example:

SELECT *
FROM machines
WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1'
   OR operating_system = 'OS 3';

The result includes rows that meet either condition or both.
NOT Operator:

Use the NOT operator to negate a condition.
Example:

SELECT *
FROM machines
WHERE NOT operating_system = 'OS 3';

The result includes rows that do not meet the specified condition.
Key Takeaways:

Use the AND operator to filter rows that meet multiple conditions simultaneously.
Use the OR operator to filter rows that meet either condition or both.
Use the NOT operator to negate a condition and filter rows that do not meet the specified condition.
