Filtering in SQL

Filtering allows selecting data that matches specific conditions, effectively choosing desired data. Think of it like selecting fresh apples from a cart of mixed fruits.

Operators in SQL

Operators are symbols or keywords representing operations in SQL. Example: the equal-to operator, denoted by =, selects records with a specific value in a column, e.g., country = 'USA.'

Using WHERE Clause

In SQL, filtering is accomplished by adding a WHERE clause after the SELECT and FROM statements. The WHERE clause specifies the condition for filtering using operators. For example, to select login attempts from the United States, use:

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country = 'USA';

Complex Conditions

SQL filters can include complex conditions that search for patterns rather than exact matches. For instance, you can use a wildcard (%) with the LIKE operator to match patterns. To filter all offices in the East building:

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE office LIKE 'East%';

LIKE Operator

The LIKE operator is used with WHERE to search for patterns in a column. It allows searching for values that match a specified pattern, where '%' acts as a wildcard for unspecified characters.

Using LIKE in a WHERE Clause

When searching for patterns using the LIKE operator, use it in the WHERE clause instead of the equals operator. For example:

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country LIKE 'US%';

Example: Inconsistent Data

Suppose the database contains variations like US and USA for the United States. You can use the LIKE operator to filter both cases, e.g., 'US%,' to match both US and USA.

Key Takeaways

- Filtering selects data based on specific conditions.
- Operators like = and LIKE are used to define conditions.
- The WHERE clause follows SELECT and FROM statements.
- LIKE with '%' acts as a wildcard to match patterns.
