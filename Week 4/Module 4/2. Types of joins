Outer Joins in SQL:

There are three types of outer joins: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. These joins allow combining two tables based on a specified column, and unlike inner joins, they return rows even if there is no match between the columns.

1. LEFT JOIN:

Returns all records from the first (left) table and matching rows from the second (right) table.
Rows from the left table that don't have a match in the right table contain NULL values in columns from the right table.
2. RIGHT JOIN:

Returns all records from the second (right) table and matching rows from the first (left) table.
Rows from the right table that don't have a match in the left table contain NULL values in columns from the left table.
3. FULL OUTER JOIN:

Returns all records from both tables.
If a row doesn't have a value for a particular column, it returns NULL.
Includes all columns from all tables.
Notes:

Syntax: Use the same structure as INNER JOIN but with keywords LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, or FULL OUTER JOIN.

EXAMPLE:
-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT employees.username, employees.office, machines.operating_system
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT employees.username, employees.office, machines.operating_system
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT employees.username, employees.office, machines.operating_system
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;


Result: The result includes rows from the specified tables based on the type of outer join, and NULL values are used for columns without a match.
